    "# Student Record Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The Student Record Management System is a menu-driven Python mini project designed to manage student information efficiently.\n",
    "It allows users to add, view, search, and delete student records using a simple console-based interface.\n",
    "The project demonstrates the practical application of core Python concepts such as data structures, functions, loops, exception handling, and file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Managing student records manually can lead to errors, data loss, and difficulty in searching or updating records.\n",
    "This project provides a simple digital solution to store and manage student details in an organized and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- View all student records  \n",
    "- Add new student records  \n",
    "- Search student details using Student ID  \n",
    "- Delete student records  \n",
    "- Menu-driven program for easy interaction  \n",
    "- Data persistence using file handling  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Fields Used\n",
    "- Student ID  \n",
    "- Student Name  \n",
    "- Course  \n",
    "- Semester  \n",
    "- Marks  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures\n",
    "- Dictionary of Lists – Used to store student details  \n",
    "- Lists – Used to store multiple values for each student attribute  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used\n",
    "- pandas  \n",
    "- numpy  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Structures\n",
    "- while loop  \n",
    "- if / elif / else statements  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Used\n",
    "- view_students() – Displays all student records  \n",
    "- add_student() – Adds a new student record  \n",
    "- search_student() – Searches a student using ID  \n",
    "- delete_student() – Deletes a student record  \n",
    "- save_to_file() – Saves student data into a file  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used\n",
    "- List methods: append(), pop(), len()  \n",
    "- Dictionary methods: keys(), values(), get()  \n",
    "- String methods: strip(), title()  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Handling\n",
    "- try / except blocks are used to handle invalid inputs such as entering text instead of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Handling\n",
    "- Student data is stored in a text file named `students.txt`.  \n",
    "- Uses `with open()` for safe reading and writing of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run the Program\n",
    "1. Open Jupyter Notebook  \n",
    "2. Open `Student_Record_Management_System.ipynb`  \n",
    "3. Run all cells or the main program cell  \n",
    "4. Follow the menu displayed on the screen  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Guidelines\n",
    "- Student ID, Semester, and Marks must be numeric values  \n",
    "- Student Name and Course should be text values  \n",
    "- Menu options must be selected using numbers only  \n",
    "- Invalid inputs will display appropriate error messages  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- Displays student records in a structured format  \n",
    "- Confirms add, search, and delete operations  \n",
    "- Saves data automatically before exiting  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Included\n",
    "- `Student_Record_Management_System.ipynb` – Main program file  \n",
    "- `README.md` – Project documentation  \n",
    "- `students.txt` – Data file (auto-generated)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The Student Record Management System successfully demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts to solve a real-world problem.\n",
    "The project is simple, user-friendly, and can be extended further by adding features such as updating marks or generating reports.\n",
